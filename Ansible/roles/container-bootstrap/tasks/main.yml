# the first play is to set up the ansible user (as root) and ensure
# that the key necessary to access the machine is present
# we also have to add the ansible user to the wheel group
# so that it can sudo

# there may be the issue with notty as well.

# we need to define a group of bootstrap hosts which have not yet been
# touched by ansible. These are directly created-vm's e.g.

# Note that this playbook has to be executed with --ask-pass since we are
# connecting for the first time.
