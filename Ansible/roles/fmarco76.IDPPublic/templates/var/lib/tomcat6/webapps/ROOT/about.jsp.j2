<h2>About IDP Public</h2>
<p>Identity Federations are an easier way to use many day-to-day ICT services. Federations allow for the distributed management of identity provision via identity providers, providing a way to provide services easily to a wide number of users. Many academic institutes provide identity providers at an institutional level, which are part of national or regional federations. The biggest such federation is <a href="http://www.geant.net/service/eduGAIN/Pages/home.aspx">EduGAIN</a>. These federations, however, do not cover the entire globe, and there are many areas of the world which do not have such federations.
<p>
You probably use an Identity Provider already - such as google or facebook - and many public institutions have individual identity services for their users. In order for service providers to trust identities from other institutes, a trusted environment - or federation - is needed. For more information about Identity Federations, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_identity">the Wikipedia entry</a> on Identity Federations, or the <a href="http://www.geant.net/service/eduGAIN/Pages/home.aspx">the GEANT Edugain</a> project.
