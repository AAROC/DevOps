  conductor:
    # The Conductor container does the heavy lifting, and provides a portable
    # Python runtime for building your target containers. It should be derived
    # from the same distribution as you're building your target containers with.
    base: centos:7
    # roles_path:   # Specify a local path containing Ansible roles
    # volumes:      # Provide a list of volumes to mount
    # environment:  # List or mapping of environment variables

  # Set the name of the project. Defaults to basename of the project directory.
  # For built services, concatenated with service name to form the built image name.
  project_name: umd

  # The deployment_output_path is mounted to the Conductor container, and the
  # `run` and `deployment` commands then write generated Ansible playbooks to it.
  # deployment_output_path: ./ansible-deployment

  # When using the k8s or openshift engines, use the following to authorize with the API.
  # Values set here will be passed to the Ansible modules. Any file paths will be mounted
  # to the conductor container, allowing the `run` command to access the API.
  #k8s_auth:
    # path to a K8s config file
    #config_file:
    # name of a context found within the config file
    #context:
    # URL for accessing the K8s API

  # When using the k8s or openshift engines, use the following to set the namespace.
  # If not set, the project name will be used. For openshift, the namespace maps to a project,
  # and description and display_name are supported.

services:
  # Add your containers here, specifying the base image you want to build from.
  # To use this example, uncomment it and delete the curly braces after services key.
  # You may need to run `docker pull ubuntu:trusty` for this to work.
