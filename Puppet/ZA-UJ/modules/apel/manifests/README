## This module requires the crond module for creating cron jobs. 
## either install that as well, or create your own crons by removing the crond::job
##
## NB: 	For now, you will have to create the database manually before the client can run.
## After applying this module, run the following manually on the host:
##
## mysql -p â€“e "create database apelclient"
## mysql -p apelclient < /usr/share/apel/client.sql
## From in MYSQL:
## mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON apelclient.* TO '<database_user>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<apel-password>';

To use this module:
* Complete all the paramaters found in the params file
* For the client: include apel::client
* For the parser: include apel::parser
