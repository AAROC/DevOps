This module requires the crond module for creating cron jobs.
Either install that as well, or create your own crons by modifying the crond::jobs within the modules
You will also need to manuall create the mysql database for now. See client.pp for more details

To use this module:
* Complete all the paramaters found in the params file
* For the client include apel::client
* For the parser include apel::parser
