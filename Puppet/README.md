# Puppet 

This is the top-level directory for the [Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com) orchestration manager code for the AAROC sites. 

The directory is organised into 
  * subdirectories for each site, which will have site-specific configuraitons and may not be fit for use at your site. 
  * The top-level directory may contain generic configuration which can be customised at the site-level, but should not break any particular site.
